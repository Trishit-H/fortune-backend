This is a hobby project.
This is an api that returns the fortunes of the fortune-mod program for linux.
All credits for quotes and fortunes go to the creators and maintainers of the fortune-mod program.

## Documentation

There is nothing much to do. If you want to get a random fortune just go to this url -

```
https://fortune-backend-y215.onrender.com/api/v1/fortune
```

It will return data in this format-

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": {
    "id": 139,
    "message": "Live in a world of your own, but always welcome visitors."
  }
}
```
